# Is Python Interpreted Language

"""
>>>> Python is both compiled and interpreted language.
        See the attached screenshot.
>>>> For python, byte-code is run in the python virtual machine.
        So we don't have any portability issue.
        Since byte-code is run in a python virtual machine, python code can be run in any machine with different architecture.
>>>> Python have different implementation like
        CPYTHON
        JPYTHON
        PyPy
        IRONPYTHON
